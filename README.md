# Conformal_Imputation
This repository contains the script *glucodensities_missing.R* with functions for applying the methodology presented in the manuscript **Conformal Inference for Personalized Imputation: Applications in Predicting Diabetes Development with Continuous Glucose Monitoring and Distributional Representations**. It also includes other three files:
* *conformal_imputations_glucodensities.html*, where it is explained step by step, with codes, the application to real data present in this manuscript,
* *conformal_imputations_simulations.html*, where a small simulation is presented,
* *functions*, with some auxiliar functions used in the analyses included in the html files.
